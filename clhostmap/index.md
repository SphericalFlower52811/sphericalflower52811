# ClHostMap: A tool to check if your website has been impersonated. (Version 1.1.3)

## What is ClHostMap?

ClHostMap (standing for Cloud Host Map) is a tool that checks many cloud providers, and many TLDs for whether your website has been registered by other people.

## Why use ClHostMap?

People often impersonate brands or companies by hosting it on a different TLD like `.net` instead of `.com`, or hosting a website with the same brand name but using a cloud hosting platform so that it is free, like using `.vercel.app` or `.pages.dev` because `.com` is registered.

Additionally, if your original company is hosted on a cloud provider for free instead of `.com`, other people can register a domain on `.com` and impersonate you.

ClHostMap allows you to input your brand name, and the tool automatically checks many TLDs and host providers. Check the features for more details.

## Features

Features of ClHostMap include:

- Using a hash to check every TLD and host provider, as some host providers return a 200 OK response code but on the frontend say it is fake. This ensures no false positives will be captured.
- 68 cloud host providers (like `.vercel.app`) and every TLD from IANA. (literally every TLD to ever exist)
- Asynchronous function so that it runs hundreds of checks all at once.
